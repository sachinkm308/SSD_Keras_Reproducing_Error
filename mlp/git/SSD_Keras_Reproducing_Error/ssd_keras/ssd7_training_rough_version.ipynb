    "# SSD7 Training Tutorial\n",

    "This tutorial explains how to train an SSD7 on the Udacity road traffic datasets, and just generally how to use this SSD implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer about SSD7:\n",
    "As you will see below, training SSD7 on the aforementioned datasets yields alright results, but I'd like to emphasize that SSD7 is not a carefully optimized network architecture. The idea was just to build a low-complexity network that is fast (roughly 127 FPS or more than 3 times as fast as SSD300 on a GTX 1070) for testing purposes. Would slightly different anchor box scaling factors or a slightly different number of filters in individual convolution layers make SSD7 significantly better at similar complexity? I don't know, I haven't tried."
